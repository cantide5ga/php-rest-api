#PHP ReST API Library

In progress. Inspired by this excellent tutorial: [http://coreymaynard.com/blog/creating-a-restful-api-with-php/](http://coreymaynard.com/blog/creating-a-restful-api-with-php/).

Quick notes on usage:
* include the aggregated rest-api.php
* using namepsace RestApi
* refer to /reference for example on using .htaccess RewriteRule to handle requests

TODO:
* include generic deployment using Ansible
* Augeas PHP bindings w/ .htacces lens for easier configuration?
